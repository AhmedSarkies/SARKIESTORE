# Ecommerce VueJS App
#### I haven't finished this project yet, I learned VueJS and started working on this project in a very short time so I'm Still developing.
##### I started to learn VueJS because I found a job looking for a VueJS developer, and it did not require any experience, I found that there might be an opportunity for me in this job, so I started studying and starting this small project, which is a very small Blog App, and then I started this project and I used Firebase in it.
